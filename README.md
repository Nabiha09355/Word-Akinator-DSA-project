# Word-Akinator-DSA-project
This DSA project was made by team effort to create a word guessing game, using TSTs(Ternary Search Trees) to help find/locate the words from a CSV file we took from the internet. The project 
runs on the command terminal, and other than just guessing words, you can add, delete, print and check for words in the dictionary, too. We also implemented a frequency checker that would work for 
the word guessing game and would increase the frequency of the word it wasn't able to guess, so that the next time the same prefix was given, it would give that word as the first guess; kind 
of like how mobile keyboards work with recommending words which are used often when typing.
